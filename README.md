# 3DDesigns
A place to create 3D models, primarily for incorporation into printed models

## Bayonet Locks
An OpenSCAD library to creating bayonet locking connector parts. This is primarily a refactoring exercise, exploiting the good work of 
[Alexandre Da Silva Xavier](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3471896) over on Thingiverse. Alexandre's work is licensed under Creative Commons - Attribution.

## Brother E550W Holder for IKEA Skadis
A Fusion360 model for the Brother E550W label printer, allowing it to be mounted on an IKEA Skadis pegboard. Requires the Universal Skadis Hooks that you can find on Thingiverse.

## Coin Holder
An OpenSCAD script to create a round coin holder. It has built-in support for a number of different currencies, but you 
can change it to suit your needs.

## UK Switch Cover for Philips Hue Remote
This is designed to cover a UK light switch and hold a single Philips Hue dimmer remote control. The original light switch is still accessible when the Hue remote is removed.

## Extra-wide Filament Slot for IKEA Lack 3D Printer Enclosure
This is a remix of a design by [Poul Anker Ersley](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433026). I needed a slightly wider slot, so I extended the design a little to give an overall length of 310mm. It just about fits on the build plate of a Prusa MK3S if you rotate it to print corner-to-corner.
