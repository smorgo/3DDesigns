 * 3D printable design for a coin holder.                            *
 *                                                                   *
 * This design is initially configured to hold a full set of UK      *
 * coins from 1p to £2. You can also print versions for other        *
 * coins, simply by specifying the currency. Or you can change the   *
 * set of coins to suit your own needs.                              *
 *                                                                   *
 * The design cleverly calculates the correct overall diameter for   *
 * the coin holder, based on the coins that it's configured to hold. *
 * Much of the calculation must be credited to my daughter, Alice    *
 * Morgan who, by applying her A-Level maths skills, gave me a       *
 * solution that was evading me.                                     *
 *                                                                   *

// used so I can include it in a later version).

// You can change existing entries, adding new ones or remove unneeded ones
// (note: if you add or remove, make sure that each coin, except the last 
// one, has a comma "," after it. If you know OpenSCAD, you'll know this, anyway.

// Each coin entry is made up of three values, text, diameter and thickness
// e.g.
// ["1",20.3,1.65] defines a UK 1 penny piece
// where: "1" is the text printed on the base
//        20.3 is the diameter of the coin in mm
//        1.65 is the thickness of the coin in mm

// Note: the design doesn't use the thickness, at the moment. Maybe a later version will.
